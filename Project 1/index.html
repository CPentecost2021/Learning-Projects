    <h1>Simple Fitness Tracker Blog</h1>

        <h3>The Idea behind this is to create accountability with my own workouts and to keep track of my progress.  While I also work on my Web Development skills to post my progress for others to see.</h3>
    
        <p>I intend to post at least weekly updates to my blog.  I will also include posts about my eating habits and recipes, mental and physical health and a the people in my life that are helping me along.
            This will be a combination Blog and Vlog as to keep peoples interest...I know how I feel when I have to read and read and read.  And I was an English Major.
            This On the Web Development side I will try to create individual project pages to challenge myself. Examples will be One page Websites, CSS Grids, Using a Paralax design and others to create a more interesting User Experience.
            This is so that I can expand and practice my new learning, which should keep me more accountable to creating updates and content.</p>
